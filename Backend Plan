Overview 🌐
The backend will handle user authentication, report storage, AI agent integrations, and provide RESTful APIs to the frontend. It will use Node.js with Express for creating the server and MongoDB for storing user and report data.

Tech Stack 🛠️
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js 🚀

Database: MongoDB 🗄️

Cloud Storage: Firebase Storage (for storing reports and images) ☁️

Authentication: Firebase Authentication 🔐

API Communication: RESTful API 🌐

Middleware: Custom error handling and authentication middleware ⚙️

API Endpoints 🌐
POST /login: Authenticate users and provide tokens. 🔐

POST /uploadReport: Handle the upload of medical reports and store them in Firebase Storage. Metadata is saved in MongoDB. 📤

GET /reports/{userId}: Retrieve a list of reports for a user, along with their metadata and analysis. 📄

POST /query: Handle user queries, passing them to the AI backend and returning responses. 🤖

GET /progress/{userId}: Fetch the user’s progress data based on historical reports and cancer progression metrics. 📊

Services ⚙️
mongoService.js: Contains utility functions to interact with MongoDB for storing and retrieving user data, reports, and progress. 🗄️

aiService.js: Integrates with the AI agents (for text analysis, image processing, etc.). This service calls the AI microservices hosted in the ai-agents folder. 🤖
